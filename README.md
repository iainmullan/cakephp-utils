# CakePHP Utils

## DebugShell

    cake util.debug <debug level>

Quickly set the app Debug level in your `app/Config/core.php` file


## CounterShell

A Console task for CakePHP to update all counterCache values. Useful during development, after a bulk data import, or when adding a new counterCache column for existing data.

In theory could be adapted to suit any type of beforeSave logic.
